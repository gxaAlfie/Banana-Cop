# Banana Cop
> RuboCop's development is moving at a very rapid pace and there are often backward-incompatible changes between minor releases (since we haven't reached version 1.0 yet). To prevent an unwanted RuboCop update you might want to use a conservative version locking in your `Gemfile`.

This repository is used as version control for Team Banana's Rubocop Settings. Most recent customization for `rubocop.yml` is based off `rubocop v0.63.1`.

# Setup Rubocop
## Install Rubocop Gem
In the project's `Gemfile`, add this to the `development` group.

```ruby
group :development do
  ...
  gem 'rubocop', '~> 0.63.1', require: false
end
```

Run the command in the terminal to install the gem for the project
```
bundle install
```

## Setup Rubocop Settings
Clone the repository in any directory
```
git clone https://github.com/gxaAlfie/Banana-Cop.git
```

Link the Rubocop Configuration File to the Home Diretory
```
ln ~/Path/To/Banana-Cop/.rubocop.yml ~/.rubocop.yml
```

# Usage
## How to Run

```sh

To run `rubocop` for a specific file / path, type the following command in the terminal:

e.g.
rubocop app/controllers/
rubocop app/controllers/application_controller.rb
